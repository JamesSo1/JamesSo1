## Hi, I'm James So ðŸ‘‹

I originally chose to study **Physics** in college because I loved imagining how things work. But it wasnâ€™t until I took a *Computation for Physics* class that I realized how much more exciting it was to **build** what I could imagine. That class led me to change my major to **Computer Science**, and opened up a whole new way for me to explore and create.

I enjoy working with **React** and am currently looking for opportunities to grow and contribute as a frontend developer.

Please feel free to explore my projects or reach out!
